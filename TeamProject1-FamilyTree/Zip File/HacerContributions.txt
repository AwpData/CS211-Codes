    In team project 1, our project was writing a family database program and creating a class to represent a person and to store references to the personâ€™s mother, father, and any children the person has. Read a file of names to initialize the name and parent-child relationships of each person. 
	  At the end of every lecture, we did a discussion for 10 minutes and our team leader assigned us responsibilities. We tried to complete responsibilities and the day after we discussed in class about what we did and he assigned new responsibilities to us and to himself. For me, the biggest obstacles were understanding to project. I asked one of the tutors in the lab, he was not able to answer my questions. My teammates explained to me what we are doing, and they made the main class. 
	  My contribution to this team was I helped them to create a person class and discussions that we did at the end of every lecture. We completed our project just on time and I think we did a very nice project.
