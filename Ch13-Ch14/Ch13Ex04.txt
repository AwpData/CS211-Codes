Exercise 4, Chapter 13

The complexity class for this algorithm can be considered as O(N). This is because the for-loop goes through the list at a linear rate
examining every element only once and executing each statement nested only once. Although there are 2 statements within the for-loop 
making this algorithm O(2N), we round off to the nearest order of magnitude which is O(N) since every element is examined and each operation nested inside the for-loop is executed exactly once.
